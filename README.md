# DataLoader
Upload multiple related Salesforce objects in one go—parents first, children next—without juggling VLOOKUPs or manual IDs. This tool lets admins and power users import hierarchical data (e.g., Account → Contact → Case or any custom object tree) reliably, with validation, partial-success reporting, and automatic parent reference resolution.
Works in Salesforce Lightning Experience. Deployed as an unlocked package or source via SFDX.
